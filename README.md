# Secure Cell Vault

A highly secure, cell-based secrets management system with fine-grained access control and API-driven architecture.

## Features

- Cell-based isolation for secrets
- Fine-grained access control
- Strong encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- Audit logging
- High availability support
- API-driven architecture
- Multiple authentication methods
- Automatic key rotation
- Transit encryption

## Architecture

The system is built with a cell-based architecture where each cell is an isolated encryption context. This provides several benefits:

1. Breach containment
2. Access segregation
3. Independent key rotation
4. Organizational alignment

## Security Features

- Hardware Security Module (HSM) support
- Automatic key rotation
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Access control lists
- Transport layer security
- At-rest encryption

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shellz-n-stuff/secure-cell-vault.git
cd secure-cell-vault

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup the configuration
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your settings

# Initialize the database
alembic upgrade head

# Start the server
uvicorn secure_cell_vault.main:app --reload
```

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive API documentation.

## Security Considerations

1. Use Hardware Security Modules (HSM) in production
2. Regular key rotation
3. Proper network segmentation
4. Regular security audits
5. Monitoring and alerting
